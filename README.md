# Weather-App
I present to you a delightful mini Python Tkinter project that I thoroughly enjoyed creating. In this repository, I am sharing the code. The project utilizes the Open Weather Map API to fetch data, enabling users to obtain weather reports for any location worldwide. By providing the name of a place, you can access information such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and description. Additionally, the project provides the current time for the specified location.
